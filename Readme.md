# How to highlight fields in CardView


<p>This sample illustrates how to highlight a particular card field when a user hovers over CardView. Within the MouseMove event a visual element under the mouse cursor is calculated. The CustomDrawCardFieldValue event is used to highlight the necessary card field. As a result, when the cursor is over an image cell, the cell is highlighted.</p>
